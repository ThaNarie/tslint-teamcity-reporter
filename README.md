# tslint-teamcity-reporter

A TSLint formatter/reporter for use in TeamCity which groups by files using TeamCity Test Suite

**Note: v3.0.0 is completely rewritten to keep it more maintainable
(borrowing from [eslint-teamcity](https://github.com/andreogle/eslint-teamcity) and [tslint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint/) internal tests),
and will be a breaking change to your configuration and output.**

#### Changes

* From the CLI, the formatter can now be specified as `-t ./node_modules/tslint-teamcity-reporter/index.js`
* The lint errors reported as tests are now grouped by file
  * This means that on the top-level, you only see failed files, not individual errors
  * The individual errors are now displayed as error output for each file
  * This means that the 'failed test count' will drop significantly, please take into account in your overall metrics
  * If you liked the old approach better, please let me know in a ticket, and I can add it back as an option
* Warnings are now treated as such, will show up in the logs and at the bottom of a failed test

## Installation

```sh
yarn add tslint-teamcity-reporter
```

```sh
npm i -D tslint-teamcity-reporter
```

## Usage

Use it with:

#### TSLint CLI

```
tslint files/**/*.ts -t ./node_modules/tslint-teamcity-reporter/index.js
```

#### grunt-tslint

```js
module.exports = grunt => {
  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-tslint');

  grunt.initConfig({
    tslint: {
      options: {
        configuration: './tslint.json',
        formatter: 'tslint-teamcity-reporter',
      },
      files: {
        src: ['**/*.ts'],
      },
    },
  });

  grunt.registerTask('default', ['tslint']);
};

```

#### gulp-tslint

```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const tslint = require('gulp-tslint');

gulp.task('tslint', () =>
  gulp
    .src('**/*.ts')
    .pipe(
      tslint({
        configuration: './tslint.json',
        formatter: 'tslint-teamcity-reporter',
        formattersDirectory: 'anything-but-falsy', // passing a falsy value will resolve in `null` and throw an error in tslint
      }),
    )
    .pipe(tslint.report()),
);

gulp.task('default', ['tslint']);
```

### Configuration

There are several ways that you can configure tslint-teamcity.
You don't have to configure anything by default, you just have the option to if you would like.
Settings are looked for in the following priority:

#### 1. From your package.json
If you have a package.json file in the current directory, you can add an extra "eslint-teamcity" property to it:

```json
{
  "tslint-teamcity": {
    "report-name": "My TSLint Violations",
    "error-statistics-name": "My TSLint Error Count",
    "warning-statistics-name": "My TSLint Warning Count"
  }
}
```

#### 2. ENV variables

```sh
export TSLINT_TEAMCITY_REPORT_NAME="My Formatting Problems"
export TSLINT_TEAMCITY_ERROR_STATISTICS_NAME="My Error Count"
export TSLINT_TEAMCITY_WARNING_STATISTICS_NAME="My Warning Count"
```

You can also output your current settings to the log if you set:

```sh
export TSLINT_TEAMCITY_DISPLAY_CONFIG=true
```
